-- | Sockets used by the web server need to be set so that they are not leaked

-- NOTE: There is a race condition here. In the time between creating the socket
-- (via either 'socket' or 'accept') and calling this function, another thread
-- can fork/exec a process that will capture a copy of this socket.
--
-- Modern linux has the SOCK_CLOEXEC flag for socket, and the new accept4
-- call for setting FD_CLOEXEC atomically with the socket creation. Alas,
-- neither the Haskell nor Mac OS X have these yet.
--
-- TODO(mzero): A possible solution is put the server and shell in separate
-- processes.
